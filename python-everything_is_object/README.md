# Python - Everything is Object

## Project Overview

This project dives into one of the most fundamental aspects of Python: **everything is an object**. It explores how Python manages variables, references, mutability, and identity. Youâ€™ll learn to distinguish between mutable and immutable types, understand variable aliasing, and discover how assignments actually work under the hood.

Understanding these concepts is essential for writing bug-free, efficient Python code and for excelling in technical interviews.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- What an object is in Python
- The difference between a class and an instance (object)
- The distinction between mutable and immutable objects
- What a reference is and how assignment works
- What aliasing means in Python
- How to check if two variables are identical (point to the same object)
- How to display an object's identifier (memory address)
- Which Python types are mutable and which are immutable
- How Python passes variables to functions (pass-by-assignment/object-reference)

---

## Project Structure

- Each question/task has its own `.txt` file containing the answer.
- No Python code is required in the answer files, unless explicitly stated.
- Each answer must be a single line, with no extra spaces before or after.
- All files must end with a new line.

---

## Usage

You can explore the answers to deepen your understanding, and try out concepts in the Python interpreter for further practice.  
To check the type of any object in Python, use:

```python
type(obj)
